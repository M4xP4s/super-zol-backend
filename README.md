## What is Super Zol?

Super Zol is a modern, scalable backend system designed for data pipeline operations. It currently features a complete Kaggle dataset processing pipeline with plans for extensive data transformation, validation, and API capabilities.

**Current Features**:

- üîê Kaggle API authentication and dataset discovery
- üì¶ Dataset download and processing workflows
- üìä Schema profiling and inventory analysis
- üèóÔ∏è Hexagonal architecture with clean separation of concerns
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test coverage (94%+, 166 tests)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ‚â•22 ([nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) recommended)
- **pnpm** ‚â•10 (installed automatically)
- **[Just](https://github.com/casey/just)** (optional, but recommended)

### Get Running in 2 Minutes

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 2. Set up environment
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Start infrastructure (optional)
just infra-up

# 4. Run quality checks
just check

# 5. Start a service
just serve-api
```

That's it! üéâ

## Key Features

### üöÄ Performance

- **Smart caching**: Nx caches build/test results for instant rebuilds
- **Affected-only**: Only test/build what changed
- **Parallel execution**: Run tasks concurrently across projects

### ‚úÖ Quality Gates

- **Pre-commit**: ESLint + Prettier on changed files (1-5s)
- **Pre-push**: TypeScript + Tests + Builds on affected projects (30-120s)
- **Commit format**: Conventional Commits enforced
- **Test coverage**: 90% minimum threshold

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture

- **Hexagonal/Clean Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Deterministic structure**: Generators ensure consistency
- **Strong typing**: Strict TypeScript with no implicit any
- **Pure ESM**: Modern module system throughout

### üõ†Ô∏è Developer Experience

- **Automated workflows**: Quick commit and PR automation scripts
- **Fast feedback**: Watch mode for instant test results
- **Clear documentation**: Comprehensive guides for all aspects
- **Git hooks**: Automated quality checks at every stage

## Development Workflow

### Solo Development (Quick Iteration)

```bash
# Make changes, then:
./scripts/quick-commit.sh "feat(api): add endpoint"
```

Automatically formats, commits, tests, and pushes to main.

### Collaborative Development (Feature Branches)

```bash
# Create branch and make changes
git checkout -b feat/my-feature

# Commit your work
git commit -m "feat(api): add authentication"

# Automated PR workflow
just merge-to-main
```

Automatically creates PR, waits for CI, merges, and cleans up.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for complete workflow details.

## Testing

We take testing seriously:

- **Framework**: Vitest (fast, modern, ESM-native)
- **Coverage**: 90% minimum threshold enforced
- **Organization**: Separate `tests/` directory for clarity
- **Strategy**: Unit, integration, and E2E tests

```bash
# Run all tests
just test

# Watch mode for TDD
just test-watch kaggle-data-api

# Coverage report
just test-coverage
```

See component-specific testing docs for detailed strategies.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Nx cache issues?**

```bash
just clean  # or: pnpm nx reset
```

**Dependency problems?**

```bash
rm -rf node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml
pnpm install
```

**Port already in use?**

```bash
lsof -i :3000  # Find process
kill -9 <PID>  # Kill process
```

See [DEVELOPMENT.md#troubleshooting](DEVELOPMENT.md#troubleshooting) for more solutions.
