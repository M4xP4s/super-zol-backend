All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added - Phase 8: Enhanced Testing (Completed)

- **Test Infrastructure** (`tests/helpers/tmp.ts`) - Reusable utilities for test setup: `makeTempDir()`, `cleanupTempDir()`, `writeCSV()`, `createDirStructure()`
- **Test Fixtures** - Deterministic test data in `tests/fixtures/datasets/`:
  - Small CSVs for unit testing (3-5 rows each)
  - Unicode filename testing (`données-français-日本語.csv`)
  - Malformed CSV for error handling
- **CLI Auth --check-only Tests** (`tests/unit/cli/auth-check-only.test.ts`) - 7 comprehensive tests for critical P0 bug fix:
  - Success scenarios (env vars, kaggle.json)
  - Failure scenarios (no credentials, API verification failure)
  - Verifies --check-only never triggers interactive prompts
  - Tests credential priority order (env vars before kaggle.json)
- **Enhanced Pattern Tests** (`tests/unit/inventory/pattern.test.ts`) - Added 3 edge case tests:
  - Non-standard filenames with date patterns
  - Dates in middle of filename
  - Files without any date patterns
- **Coverage Configuration** (`vitest.config.ts`) - Enforced thresholds (90/80/90/90) with:
  - Intelligent exclusions (interfaces/ports, CLI commands, domain entities)
  - JSON summary reporter for CI integration
  - Architectural awareness (hexagonal architecture layers)
- **Documentation Enhancement** (`docs/phase-8-9.md`) - Added 600+ lines of implementation guidance:
  - Execution order with priorities (P0-P3)
  - Quality benchmarks from Phase 2
  - Risk areas and mitigation strategies
  - Task dependency diagram (Mermaid)
  - Code examples and troubleshooting guide
- **Create-PR Skill** (`.claude/skills/create-pr/`) - Automated PR creation following repository CI validation requirements

### Fixed - Phase 8

- **[P0] CLI --check-only flag triggering interactive prompts** - The `--check-only` flag in auth command was not properly preventing interactive setup when credentials were missing, breaking CI/automation workflows. Fixed by checking flag before calling `ensureKaggleAuth()` and returning early with proper exit code.

### Technical Details - Phase 8

- **Test Metrics**: 166 tests (up from 156, +10 new tests), 100% pass rate, 1.6s execution time
- **Coverage**: 94.68% statements (target: 90%), 83.45% branches (target: 80%), 100% functions (target: 90%)
- **Quality**: Zero flaky tests (3x consecutive runs, all passed), zero critical issues
- **Architecture**: Perfect hexagonal architecture implementation with mock adapters for pure business logic testing
- **Reviews**: Approved by 3 specialized agents (Architect: 9.8/10, Test Quality: 9.3/10, Bug Review: 9.5/10)
- **PR**: #9 on branch `claude-p8`, all CI checks passing
- **Comprehensive review documentation**: `reviews/PHASE-8-REVIEW-SUMMARY.md`

### Added - Phase 8–9 Plan (Testing, Docs & Polish)

- Added combined, granular plan for phases 8 and 9 in `docs/phase-8-9.md` covering:
  - Exhaustive unit/edge-case tests, integration/E2E flows, and opt-in performance baselines
  - Coverage gates aligned to 90% repo standard and CI-friendly commands
  - Comprehensive JSDoc coverage for public APIs, user README, and Python→TypeScript migration guide
  - Final polish tasks for CLI UX (`--check-only`, latest-dir resolution) and documentation quality

### Added - Phase 7: CLI Interface

- **CLI main entry point** (`src/cli/index.ts`) - Main CLI orchestrator using commander framework with version detection
- **Auth command** (`src/cli/commands/auth.ts`) - Kaggle authentication workflow with `--check-only` option
- **Download command** (`src/cli/commands/download.ts`) - Dataset download with `--dataset-id` and `--dry-run` options
- **Inventory command** (`src/cli/commands/inventory.ts`) - Dataset inventory analysis with optional directory argument
- **Profile command** (`src/cli/commands/profile.ts`) - Schema profiling with `--data-dir` and `--output` options
- **All-in-one command** (`src/cli/commands/all.ts`) - Complete workflow orchestration (auth → download → inventory → profile)
- **CLI README** (`src/cli/README.md`) - Comprehensive documentation with installation guide, command examples, common workflows, and troubleshooting
- **CLI integration tests** - 21 new tests for CLI command structure and configuration
- **CLI target in project.json** - Nx configuration for running CLI via `nx run fetch-kaggle:cli`

### Fixed - Phase 7

- **[P0] Profile command directory resolution** - Fixed TypeError when `--data-dir` omitted; now automatically resolves latest directory
- **[P0] All command directory handling** - Fixed workflow failure at step 3/4 when `--data-dir` not provided; now resolves directory once and passes to inventory/profile
- **[P1] Auth command check-only flag** - Fixed `--check-only` being ignored; now properly skips interactive setup when flag is present

### Technical Details - Phase 7

- All CLI commands properly wire to existing library functions with zero business logic duplication
- Proper error handling with user-friendly messages and correct exit codes (0 for success, 1 for failure)
- Full help text for all commands with descriptive options
- All 156 tests passing (32 test files) with proper command structure validation
- ESLint passes with zero errors and zero warnings
- Commands executable via: `node dist/jobs/fetch-kaggle/cli/index.js <command> [options]`
- Tested dry-run functionality for download command

### Added - Phase 6: Schema Profiling

- **Profile family detection module** (`detectFileFamily`) - Identifies file families and retail chains from Kaggle dataset filenames
- **Profile file selection module** (`chooseRepresentativeFiles`) - Selects one representative CSV file per family based on row count preference
- **Column summarization module** (`summarizeColumn`) - Analyzes individual columns for null rate, data type, unique count, samples, min/max statistics
- **CSV profiler module** (`profileFile`) - Parses CSV files and generates detailed column-level statistics and profiles
- **Directory profiler module** (`profileDirectory`) - Aggregates profiles for multiple representative files and coordinates profiling workflow
- **Profile orchestrator** (`runProfile`) - Coordinates full profiling workflow: manifest parsing → file selection → profiling → JSON output
- **Comprehensive test suite for profiling** - 28 new tests across 6 modules (family, select, column, file, directory, integration) with 100% pass rate
- **FileTarget type** to inventory entities for improved type safety in profile workflow

### Technical Details - Phase 6

- Implemented custom CSV parser (handles quoted fields, escaping) without external dependencies
- All modules follow TDD methodology with comprehensive test coverage
- Full test coverage: 134 total tests passing, 93.72% statement coverage, 100% function coverage
- Strict TypeScript with no implicit any types
- All linting passes with zero errors
- ESM-compatible implementation with proper module exports

The format is based on Keep a Changelog and this project adheres to Semantic Versioning.
