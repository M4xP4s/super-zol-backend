# TODO: Backend System Development

## Overview

Building a TypeScript backend system for data pipeline operations, starting with Kaggle dataset processing.

## Completed

### ✅ Epic 1: Kaggle Dataset Download & Processing Pipeline

**Goal:** Complete TypeScript implementation of Kaggle dataset operations

**Deliverables:**

- Authentication system (env vars, kaggle.json, interactive setup)
- Download workflow (fetch, process, manifest, validate)
- Inventory analysis (pattern detection, distribution reports)
- Schema profiling (CSV parsing, column statistics)
- CLI interface (auth, download, inventory, profile commands)
- Comprehensive test coverage (166 tests, 94%+ coverage)
- Developer infrastructure (scripts, hooks, documentation)

**Status:** ✅ Complete - All phases implemented and tested
