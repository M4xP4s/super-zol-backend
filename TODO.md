# TODO: Migrate Kaggle Features from Python to TypeScript

Goal

- Migrate all Kaggle-related features from the original Python project to TypeScript within `jobs/fetch-kaggle`, following Nx monorepo conventions.
- Use TDD with strict TypeScript and maintain high coverage.

Phases & Status

- ✅ Phase 0: Setup & infrastructure
- ✅ Phase 1: Types & schemas
- ✅ Phase 2: Core utilities (console, fs, hash, csv)
- ✅ Phase 3: Authentication (env, kaggle.json, API verify, setup, orchestrator)
- ✅ Phase 4: Download workflow (fetch, process, manifest, validate, orchestrator)
- ✅ Phase 5: Inventory analysis
- ✅ Phase 6: Profiling
- ✅ Phase 7: CLI interface (auth, download, inventory, profile, all)
- ✅ Phase 8: Enhanced testing (coverage gates, fixtures, helpers)
- ✅ Phase 9: Docs & polish (ongoing maintenance)

Quality Gates

- Repository standard coverage: ~90% statements/lines/branches/functions.
- Pre-push hooks run `tsc`, affected tests, and affected builds.
- ESLint and Prettier aligned with Nx and repo rules.

Deliverables

- Auth, download, inventory, and profile modules with unit/integration tests.
- CLI commands wiring to library functions without duplicating business logic.
- Manifests and reports under `jobs/fetch-kaggle/data`.
