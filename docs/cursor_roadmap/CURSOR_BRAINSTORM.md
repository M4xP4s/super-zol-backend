Perfect — that’s an excellent applied-AI direction.
You’re basically describing a **“Personalized Smart Grocery Optimizer”**, which fits _every layer_ of the AI Engineer syllabus while also creating real economic value.

Here’s what I’ll include in the `BRAINSTORM.md`:

### 🧠 Overview (short intro)

Summarize the Kaggle dataset’s structure (chains, prices, promos, stores, frequency).
Explain why it’s a goldmine for building an AI stack — ETL → Embeddings → LLMs → Agents → Production.

### 🚀 Projects (each 2–4 pages)

#### **1. Data Foundation & Normalization Service**

**Topics:** Python Essentials + ML Foundations + Infrastructure
**Goal:** unify all supermarket feeds into a single normalized schema (products, chains, timestamps).
**Value:** provides a reliable base for analytics & price comparison.
**Phases (Spec + TDD):**

- Spec model for `Product`, `Store`, `PriceRecord`
- Write parsing & validation tests for each chain file
- Build ETL pipeline (FastAPI + Docker)
- CI for schema tests

---

#### **2. Similar-Product Finder (Embedding-Based)**

**Topics:** NLP + RAG + Vector Search
**Goal:** cluster products with slightly different names (“Tnuva 1 L milk 3%” ≈ “Tara milk 3% 1L”).
**Value:** enables cross-brand substitution suggestions.
**Phases:**

- Spec: text-normalization, Hebrew ↔ English handling
- Tests for tokenization & similarity thresholds
- Train SBERT / USE embeddings → store in pgvector or FAISS
- Expose REST API for “find similar products”

---

#### **3. Price Intelligence Engine**

**Topics:** ML Foundations + Model Reasoning
**Goal:** compute cheapest store for a given basket & forecast near-term changes.
**Value:** dynamic “Best Store Today” map.
**Phases:**

- Spec: basket schema & comparison formula
- Write unit tests for aggregation logic
- Train regression model for price trends
- Generate chain-level leaderboard daily via n8n workflow

---

#### **4. Smart Cart Optimizer (LLM + RAG)**

**Topics:** LLM Integration + Prompt Engineering + Applied LLM Engineering
**Goal:** natural-language query → optimized cart (“Find me 5 breakfast items under 50 ₪”).
**Value:** user-facing chat assistant combining retrieval + reasoning.
**Phases:**

- Spec prompt templates (“optimize my cart for X ₪ limit”)
- TDD mock responses → validate LLM reasoning steps
- Connect LangChain/LlamaIndex to price vector DB
- Implement MCP client/server for structured cart responses

---

#### **5. Multi-Store Optimizer Agent**

**Topics:** AI Agents + Automation (n8n) + LLM Reasoning
**Goal:** combine 1 & 2 → “If you buy Tnuva instead of Tara, your cart at Rami Levi is 12% cheaper.”
**Value:** fully automated decision assistant for households or apps like “SuperSmart.”
**Phases:**

- Spec: agent goals (cheapest store / max discount)
- Unit tests for decision logic and API calls
- Integrate price and embedding APIs into n8n agent workflow
- Deploy FastAPI backend + LangChain agent container

---

#### **6. Promo Watcher & Notifier**

**Topics:** Workflow Automation + n8n + Infra Deployment
**Goal:** track daily price and promo dumps → notify users on Telegram/Email when basket drops > X%.
**Value:** retention + real-time value.
**Phases:**

- Spec webhook events and user prefs
- Tests for cron triggers and price thresholds
- n8n HTTP trigger → Python service → LLM summary
- Dockerize and monitor with Prometheus + Grafana

---

#### **7. Ethics & Production Deployment**

**Topics:** From Code to Production + CI/CD + Observability
**Goal:** make the whole ecosystem deployable as microservices with safe AI usage.
**Value:** portfolio-ready project that demonstrates professional AI engineering.
**Phases:**

- Spec CI stages (ETL → Inference → Agent)
- GitHub Actions tests for Docker images
- Logging & W&B tracking
- Add privacy filters for user queries
