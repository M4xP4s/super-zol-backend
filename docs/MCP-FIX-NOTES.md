# MCP Server Configuration Fix

## Problem

The `nx-mcp` MCP client was failing to handshake with "connection closed: initialize response" error.

## Root Cause

The `.mcp.json` configuration was trying to use `nx mcp` command, which doesn't exist in Nx 19.8.0:

```json
// ❌ INCORRECT (Nx 19.8.0)
"args": ["nx", "mcp"]
```

The `nx mcp` command was added in Nx 21.x+. Since this project uses Nx 19.8.0, it needs to use the standalone `nx-mcp` package instead.

## Solution Applied

Updated `.mcp.json` to use the standalone `nx-mcp` package:

```json
// ✅ CORRECT
"args": ["nx-mcp@latest"]
```

## Configuration Details

**Current Setup:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nx-mcp": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["nx-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

**What it does:**

- Uses `npx` to run `nx-mcp@latest` (version 0.8.0)
- Communicates via stdio (standard input/output)
- Provides Nx workspace context to Claude Code and other AI tools

## Version Information

- **Nx Version**: 19.8.0
- **nx-mcp Version**: 0.8.0 (latest)
- **Nx `configure-ai-agents` Command**: Not available in 19.8.0 (available in Nx 21.x+)

## Nx 22.0.2 Upgrade Complete ✅

After upgrading to Nx 22.0.2, the built-in `nx mcp` command is now available and recommended:

**Updated Configuration (Nx 22.0.2+)**:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nx-mcp": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["nx", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Changes in 22.0.2**:

- ✅ Nx now includes native MCP server support with `nx mcp` command
- ✅ No longer need standalone `nx-mcp@latest` package
- ✅ Built-in command automatically integrates with workspace
- ✅ All quality checks pass (lint, typecheck, tests)

**Upgrade Details**:

- Nx: 19.8.0 → 22.0.2
- TypeScript: 5.6.0 → 5.9.3
- Fastify: 4.13.0 → 5.2.2
- All @nx packages: 19.8.0 → 22.0.2

## Notes for Future

Both approaches work correctly:

1. **Nx 22.0.2+**: Use `nx mcp` (recommended, built-in)
2. **Nx 21.x**: Use `nx-mcp@latest` (standalone package)
3. **Nx 19.x**: Use `nx-mcp@latest` (standalone package)
