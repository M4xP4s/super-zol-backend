# BRAINSTORM: AI Engineering × Israeli Grocery Data

## Data Nature & Characteristics

### Israeli Supermarkets 2024 Dataset

**Size**: ~6.7GB, 37.9M+ rows
**Coverage**: 40+ Israeli supermarket chains
**Update Frequency**: Daily (4-hour scrape cycles)
**Languages**: Bilingual (Hebrew/English)

**Key Data Types**:

1. **Price Data**: Current prices across all chains, historical price trends
2. **Product Catalog**: 100K+ products with names, barcodes, categories
3. **Promotions**: Active deals, discounts, bundle offers
4. **Store Information**: Locations, branches, operating hours
5. **Temporal Patterns**: Seasonal variations, holiday pricing, inflation trends

**Unique Challenges**:

- Mixed encoding (UTF-8, Windows-1255)
- Inconsistent product naming across chains
- Hebrew text processing and transliteration
- High price volatility during holidays/events
- Regional price variations

## Implementation Philosophy

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Every feature starts with tests:

1. RED: Write failing test for desired behavior
2. GREEN: Implement minimal code to pass
3. REFACTOR: Improve code while maintaining tests

### Spec-Driven Development

Clear specifications before coding:

- JSON Schema for all APIs
- Zod/Pydantic for data validation
- OpenAPI documentation
- Behavioral contracts

### Production-First Mindset

- Monitoring from day one
- Security by design
- Scalability considerations
- Documentation as code

## Success Metrics

### Technical Excellence

- > 90% test coverage
- <200ms API response times
- > 99.5% system availability
- <5% LLM hallucination rate

### Business Impact

- 10K+ active users within 6 months
- 15-25% average household savings
- > 85% user satisfaction rating
- Zero compliance violations

### Learning Outcomes

- Master entire AI Engineering stack
- Build production-grade systems
- Create impactful portfolio
- Ready for AI Engineering roles

## Next Steps

1. **Week 1**: Set up development environment, begin data pipeline
2. **Week 2**: Complete ETL, start ML model development
3. **Week 3**: Deploy similarity engine, begin price intelligence
4. **Checkpoint**: Review progress, adjust timeline if needed
